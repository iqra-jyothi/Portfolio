Hi, I’m Jyothi, a passionate Full-Stack Developer currently pursuing my studies at City Engineering College.

My journey into technology began with a deep curiosity about how websites and applications come to life. What started as exploring basic web pages soon turned into a genuine passion for building dynamic, user-centered applications that solve real problems.

Throughout my learning path, I’ve developed solid skills in React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Spring Boot, and MySQL, which allow me to build complete web solutions — from beautiful interfaces to powerful backends. I love blending design and logic to create seamless digital experiences.

I’ve worked on several exciting projects that helped me grow as a developer, including:
🎵 Music Application – an interactive platform that allows users to upload, explore, and manage their favorite tracks.
💬 Chat Application – a real-time communication app with secure message storage and a clean user experience.
📄 Resume Assist – a smart resume helper that extracts and organizes information to help users create professional profiles easily.

Each project has strengthened my ability to think critically, write clean code, and deliver complete, functional solutions.

Beyond coding, I’m passionate about learning new technologies, improving user interfaces, and turning creative ideas into meaningful digital products. I believe that every line of code should make someone’s experience smoother, faster, and more enjoyable.

In the future, I aspire to become a skilled full-stack engineer contributing to innovative web applications that make a real impact. Technology is always evolving, and I’m excited to grow alongside it — learning, building, and sharing along the way.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new design ideas, staying up-to-date with the latest in web trends, or simply brainstorming my next project.
